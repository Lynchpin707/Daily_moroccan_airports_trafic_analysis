# 🛫 Morocco Airport Traffic Intelligence System
## Data Engineering Project at L'ONDA (Office National Des Aéroports)


 **Real-time airport traffic analytics using FlightRadar24 API for Morocco's top 5 airports, delivering strategic insights for operational optimization.**

## 📋 Project Overview

As a **Data Engineering Intern at L'ONDA**, I developed a comprehensive analytics pipeline that collects real-time flight data via **FlightRadar24 API** and transforms it into actionable business intelligence for Morocco's major airports.

### 🎯 Business Impact
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live flight tracking and performance analysis
- **Operational Efficiency**: Identified key bottlenecks and optimization opportunities  
- **Strategic Planning**: Data-driven insights for capacity and resource allocation
- **Predictive Analytics**: Traffic forecasting for proactive decision-making
