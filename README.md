# üõ´ Daily Moroccan Airport Traffic Analysis
## Project Overview

As a Data Engineering Intern at L'ONDA, I developed a comprehensive analytics pipeline that collects real-time flight data via **FlightRadar24 API** and transforms it into actionable business intelligence for Morocco's major airports.

### Business Impact
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live flight tracking and performance analysis
- **Operational Efficiency**: Identified key bottlenecks and optimization opportunities  
- **Strategic Planning**: Data-driven insights for capacity and resource allocation
- **Predictive Analytics**: Traffic forecasting for proactive decision-making

### Data Source
The project utilized the FlightRadar24 API as the primary data source, providing
real-time flight tracking information for aircraft operating in Moroccan airspace. Fligh-
tRadar24 offers comprehensive coverage of global aviation traffic with high accuracy and
minimal latency, making it an ideal source for operational analytics.
